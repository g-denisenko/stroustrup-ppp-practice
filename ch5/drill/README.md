### ðŸ“š DRILL

---

1. Take the calculator from the file `calculator02buggy.cpp`. Get it to compile. You need to find and fix a few bugs. Those bugs are not in the text in the book. Find the three logic errors deviously inserted in `calculator02buggy.cpp` and remove them so that the calculator produces correct results.


2. Change the character used as the exit command from `q` to `x`.


3. Change the character used as the print command from `;` to `=`.


4. â€œAdd a greeting line in `main()`:

```c
"Welcom to our simple calculator.
Please, enter expressions using floating-point numbers."
```

5. Improve that greeting by mentioning which operators are available and how to print and exit.
