### ⭐️ Welcome words

This repository contains my personal practice exercises from **Bjarne Stroustrup’s book “Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++”** (widely known as **PPP**).

I created it for several reasons:
1. To organize my learning structure and approach.
2. To track my education progress.
3. To revisit exercises later and rewrite them with improved knowledge.

I hope others learning from this book will find it helpful—it’s always useful to compare different solutions to the same tasks.


For my future clients, this repository also serves as a bonus insight into:
- My coding style
- My current programming experience
 
😎 ***Happy exploring!***
